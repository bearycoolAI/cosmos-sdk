Describe your PR
_Summarize your changes here 👍 Okay here it goes, I have been imagining within this .devcontainer... certain upgrade infrastructure protocols that we can utilize within the clever cloud domain, this begins the stub and onboarding the .devcontainer into the Clever-Cloud Protcol.

Project Documentation
Overview
This project comprises two modular engines, imaginerunner.cpp and codingrabbitai.cpp, designed for dynamic task execution and CI/CD workflow automation. The project also includes a robust setup for Clever Cloud .devcontainer configuration and automation scripts.

Engines
imaginerunner.cpp
Description
A modular engine designed for task execution with a focus on:

Concurrency: Executes tasks in parallel using threads.
Dynamic Configuration: Manages environment configurations dynamically.
API Integration: Supports authenticated API requests with OAuth via libcurl.
Key Features
Task Management: Modular tasks with error handling, executed in parallel.
Environment Handling: Dynamically loads and manages variables from configuration files.
API Requests: Authenticated interactions with external services.
Error Handling: Ensures robust execution with detailed logging.
codingrabbitai.cpp
Description
An automation engine focused on RabbitProtocol CI/CD workflows with capabilities such as:

Building modular components.
Running tests.
Deploying to external systems like Azure.
Key Features
CI/CD Automation: Encapsulates build, test, and deploy workflows.
Environment Integration: Dynamically loads .env files for flexible configurations.
Task Modularization: Pre-defined, reusable tasks (e.g., building with gcc, deploying to Azure).
Detailed Logging: Logs command execution and errors for troubleshooting.
Comparison of Core Features
Feature | imaginerunner.cpp | codingrabbitai.cpp -- | -- | -- Task Management | Modular tasks with parallel execution. | Encapsulates CI/CD steps. Environment Handling | Dynamic file-based variable management. | Manages .env files dynamically. API Integration | OAuth via libcurl. | No explicit API integration. Concurrency | Parallel task execution with threads. | Sequential execution. Error Handling | Exception-safe task execution. | Logs errors for task/command failures. Build & Deployment | Generic task execution logic. | Pre-defined CI/CD workflows.
Strengths
imaginerunner.cpp
Concurrency: Efficient parallel task execution with thread management.
API Integration: Modular OAuth interactions with external services.
Dynamic Configuration: Flexible environment variable handling.
Error Resilience: Robust handling with detailed logs.
codingrabbitai.cpp
Automation Focus: Comprehensive CI/CD workflow automation.
Modular Tasks: Reusable and pre-defined for common CI/CD steps.
Environment Integration: Seamless .env file handling.
Detailed Logging: Comprehensive logs for debugging.
Areas for Improvement
imaginerunner.cpp
Task Dependencies: Add support for task dependencies to improve workflow coordination.
CI/CD Support: Introduce specific modules for builds and deployments.
Task State Management: Implement status tracking for tasks (e.g., success, failure).
codingrabbitai.cpp
Concurrency: Introduce parallel execution for independent tasks.
Error Handling: Add retries for transient failures (e.g., network issues).
API Integration: Include modular API handlers like in imaginerunner.cpp.
Code Organization: Refactor repetitive logic into reusable utilities.
Potential Enhancements
Merge Engine Strengths:

Combine imaginerunner.cpp’s API integration and concurrency features with codingrabbitai.cpp’s CI/CD focus.
Unified Scheduler:

Develop a task scheduler capable of handling both parallel and sequential tasks with dependency resolution.
Dynamic Task Loading:

Enable dynamic task configuration via JSON or YAML files for flexibility.
Enhanced Logging:

Include timestamps, task statuses, and execution summaries in logs.
Cross-Platform Support:

Ensure compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Improved Error Handling:

Add categorized handling for specific errors (e.g., network or command failures).
